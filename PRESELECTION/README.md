# Preselection of sub-model combination

This directory provides four prepared subsets of sub-models, each tailored to specific ranges of fuels and conditions. 

## 1. Complete Model
Includes all sub-models of C3MechV4.0. Use this option if you need the full scope of available reactions and fuels.

## 2. C0_C6_HT_PAH
Targets high-temperature oxidation of C0–C6 fuel components, including mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Suited for simulations of unstretched premixed and counterflow flames, high-temperature flow reactors, and shock tubes.

## 3. C0_C6_PAH
It covers the oxidation chemistry of C0–C6 fuel components with PAHs and is intended for low- and high-temperature applications. This subset can be used to simulate jet-stirred reactors, flow reactors under lower-temperature conditions, and rapid compression machine (RCM) experiments.

## 4. TPRF
This sub-model combination focuses on Toluene Primary Reference Fuel (TPRF) mixtures and includes PAH chemistry.
