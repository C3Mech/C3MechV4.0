# Species dictionary

All species in the C3 model are defined in `species_dict.csv`. This CSV file has
seven columns with the following meaning:
- `model_name`: name used in the CHEMKIN files (upper case ASCII string)
- `inchi`:  International Chemical Identifier (ASCII string)
- `smiles`: a string following the simplified molecular-input line-entry system 
  (ASCII string)
- `excited`: `1` if excited; otherwise, `0` (boolean)
- `multiplicity`: multiplicity of a species' energy level (`0` if unspecified,
  `1` for singlets, `2` for doublets, `3` for triplets, etc.) (non-negative 
  integer)
- `lumped`: `1` if the `model_name` represents multiple InChIs that should be 
  tracked in the dictionary; otherwise, `0` (boolean)
- `stereochemistry`: `1` for RDKit compatible stereochemistry information; 
  otherwise `0` (boolean)

The combination `inchi`-`excited`-`multiplicity` must be unique for each row.
Simplified identifiers neglecting stereochemistry information derived from the
values in the `inchi` and `smiles` columns must still be RDKit compatible and 
consistent if the value in the `stereochemistry` column is `0`.

# Modifying the species dictionary

The only file that contains data and should be modified is 
`species_dict.csv`. If a species of interest is unavailable, the SMILES 
formula can typically be generated by hand, starting, for example, from a 
SMILES formula for a similar species. 
[CDK DEPICT](https://www.simolecule.com/cdkdepict/depict.html) can be useful 
for the on-the-fly generation of a structure when modifying a SMILES formula. 
You can convert the _comma-separated_ SMILES formulas to InChIs:

```sh
./smiles2inchi.py "C=CCN([O])[O], C=C(C)N([O])[O]"
```

Vice versa, _semicolon-separated_ InChIs can be converted to SMILES formulas with the 
following command:

```sh
./inchi2smiles.py "InChI=1S/C3H7NO2/c1-3(2)4(5)6/h3H,1-2H3; InChI=1S/C2H4NO2/c1-2-5-3-4/h1-2H2"
```

Now, you can add the new rows to `species_dict.csv` and check them with the following command:

```sh
./make_species_dict.py -d
```

# Installing dependencies

You can install the dependencies, for example, with:

```sh
pip3 install rdkit CairoSVG gitpython pyyaml pandas numpy yapf --user
```

Alternatively, you can use conda:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

The scripts were tested with Python versions 3.8.5 and 3.9.6.

# Modifying to the Python scripts

The Python source code should be [formatted](https://github.com/google/yapf) 
with the following style:

```sh
yapf smiles2inchi.py -i --style='{based_on_style: pep8, indent_width: 2}'
```

# Generating the species dictionary

The following commands generate the output file `species_dict.pdf`:

```sh
# Select the relevant submodels for the species dictionary the yaml input (default is submodels.yaml).
# Species images will only be updated if older than the species dictionary csv file. Erase the content 
# of the output directory to force a regeneration of the species images. 
./make_species_dict.py
# use ./make_species_dict.py -d to perform checks without output generation (faster)
cd output
pdflatex species_dict.tex
```
